# Rosy Tunes

Keep track of your musical journey!

## Motivation

This project was born with the intention of improving an old set of spreadsheets I used to rate the songs I listened to. I stopped using them for a while, and when I came back to them to undertake my most ambitious listen yet (the full discography of the Rolling Stones, if you were wondering) I realized how cumbersome they were, and how much they could be improved with a bit of Ruby on Rails.
By nature of making this a web app, it will let other people use it if they find it helpful.

The simplest vision for this app is to allow users to keep track of the music they listened and want to listen to. 
They'll be able to rate each record according to what they think of it at the time, slowly building up a chronological history of their musical journey.
It will then be possible to review the journey, analyze it, plan new listens, and feel accomplished.

## Planned features
- Song and album catalogue. It may be initially restricted to a particular music genre (rock, of course) to make it more manageable.
- Layered rating system for individual songs and overwritable aggregate rating for fully listened albums.
